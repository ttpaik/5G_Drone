# 5G Aerial Network Modeling

## Installation

### Machine Learning

Retrieve Data from the Google Firebase Realtime Database.
Convert the JSON file retrieved by executing the JSON_to_CSV.py file
Running the Linear_Reg.py will show predicted network speed, error rates, and accuracy.

### Mobile Application

Get [Google api keys](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=09:99:E5:A3:47:98:40:10:17:0B:8F:3C:53:11:58:19:1C:62:AE:CA;com.example.myapplication&project=capable-code-313408&pli=1)<br />
Get Ookla SDK keys and<br />
val testConfigBgSpeed = "..."<br />
val testConfigBgScan =  "..."

### Web Application

The source code for this will be found in the "flaskapp" branch.

This web app uses the Flask framework and includes files written in Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

In addition to the above, there are necessary modules used in Python that should be installed along with **flask** itself: **numpy, pandas and sklearn**.

Each can be installed by running:
```
pip install _modulename_
```

Prior to running the website, an up-to-date machine learning model must be created in the form of a "pickle", a Python serializable object.

This model is built upon an existing dataset (results.csv) and can be generated by running the prediction file as below:
```
python predict.py
```

Last but not least, a Google Maps API key must be entered for full functionality.

In the pred.html file, an individual key (obtained for free by Google Cloud) must be entered. This can be done by editing the following lines as such:
```
<script 
        src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOURAPIKEY&callback=initMap&v=weekly">
</script>
```

Finally, the website can be opened by running:
```
python -m flask run 
```

The website will run locally, which can be opened by doing a CTRL+click on the link displayed in terminal.
